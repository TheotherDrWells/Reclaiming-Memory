# Reclaiming Memory: A Local‑First Architecture for AI Continuity

This repository contains the white paper, design specifications, and future implementation roadmap for a user-owned, encrypted memory system that enables persistent, portable, model-agnostic AI continuity.

## Contents
- `whitepaper/`: The full LaTeX and PDF version of the white paper
- `spec/`: Open spec for the Interoperable Memory Protocol (IMP)
- `example/`: Sample encrypted memory entries
- `agent/`: Design notes for a local memory daemon
- `LICENSE`: Open access under MIT

## Why This Matters
Current AI systems trap user memory within closed platforms. This project proposes a structural inversion—making memory local, encrypted, and portable—so models compete on quality, not retention.
